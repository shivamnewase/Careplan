### Test data seeder scripts

The Python scripts written here generate SQL scripts which can be used to seed the test data.

You can go to any mock data generator sites such as [mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) and generate test data json file based. Once generated, you create a Python script to generate SQL to insert the data into relevant tables.

You can use existing scripts as template.
